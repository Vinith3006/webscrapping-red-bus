# Redbus-Data-Scraping-
This project aims to automate the extraction and analysis of bus route data from the Redbus website. The focus is on gathering comprehensive details about both government and private bus services, including route information, bus types, pricing, star ratings, and seat availability. By utilizing web scraping techniques and developing an interactive application, this project provides valuable insights and an easy-to-use platform for users to explore and filter bus service data.


Key Features

Web Scraping with Selenium: Automates the process of extracting bus route and schedule information directly from the Redbus website.

Data Storage in MySQL: Efficiently stores the scraped data in a structured MySQL database, enabling quick and flexible data retrieval.

Interactive Streamlit Application: Offers a user-friendly interface for filtering and analyzing the bus service data. Users can filter results based on bus type, route, price range, star rating, and seat availability.

Data Analysis and Visualization: Provides clear insights through data visualizations, helping users make informed decisions about bus travel options.

Technologies Used

Selenium: For web scraping and browser automation.

MySQL: For robust and scalable data storage.

SQLAlchemy: For managing database connections and executing SQL queries.

Streamlit: For building an interactive web application that allows users to filter and visualize the data.

Python: The primary programming language used for scripting, data manipulation, and application development.

Project Objectives

Automate Data Extraction: Develop a reliable and efficient method to scrape bus service data from the Redbus website.

Store Data Systematically: Organize the scraped data in a MySQL database to facilitate easy access and management.

Create a User-Friendly Interface: Build a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with the data, apply filters, and gain insights through visualizations.

Provide Valuable Insights: Enable users to analyze bus service data based on various criteria, helping them make better travel decisions.

This project combines the power of web scraping, data storage, and interactive data visualization to create a comprehensive tool for exploring bus services. It is designed to be both functional and accessible, making it easier for users to find the information they need efficiently.
